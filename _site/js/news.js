I've been meaning to get familiar with <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">Amazon's EC2</a> for a while so I've decided to try and use a micro instance there. You can get this free for a year as long as your usage isn't too high"

The whole site is small enough right now that I can get away just building all the data sources directly into the code. I'll change this to use an API later on."
